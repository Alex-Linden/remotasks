# # This program first imports the `text2num` and `re` libraries. The `identify_numbers` function is defined, which takes a string as an argument.

# # The function uses the `findall` method from the `re` library to find all digit sequences in the string using the regular expression pattern `r'\d+'`. The results are stored in `num_list`.

# # Next, the function iterates over each word in the string, extracts the textual spelling of the number and attempts to convert it into a number using the `to_num` method from the `text2num` library. If the conversion is successful, the number is appended to the `text_num_list`. The function also catches any exceptions raised by `text2num` to prevent crashes if text that cannot be converted to numbers (such as 'five') is encountered.

# # The `num_list` and `text_num_list` are combined into a single list `all_nums`. The `int` function is used to convert any non-integer entries to integers, as `re.findall` might return floats and `text2num` might return long integers. Duplicates are removed using the `dict.fromkeys` method.

# # The `identify_numbers` function is then tested with an example string, which should produce the result `[123456789, 500]` when printed to the console.
