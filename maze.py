 Ah, I apologize for the mistake. Here is a simple 10x10 maze with a player class and a game to play. The maze is a bit simpler, but you can extend it as needed. This game doesn't have a goal or winning condition. It just lets you move around the maze.

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def move(self, direction):
        if direction == 'up':
            if maze[self.y - 1][self.x] == 'B':
                print("There is a wall going up.")
            else:
                self.y -= 1
        elif direction == 'down':
            if maze[self.y + 1][self.x] == 'B':
                print("There is a wall going down.")
            else:
                self.y += 1
        elif direction == 'left':
            if maze[self.y][self.x - 1] == 'B':
                print("There is a wall going left.")
            else:
                self.x -= 1
        elif direction == 'right':
            if maze[self.y][self.x + 1] == 'B':
                print("There is a wall going right.")
            else:
                self.x += 1

# simple 10x10 maze
maze = [['B', 'B', 'B', 'O', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B'],
        ['B', 'B', 'B', ' ', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B'],
        ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B'],
        ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B'],
        ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B'],
        ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B'],
        ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B'],
        ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B'],
        ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B'],
        ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]

player = Player(0, 0)
while True:
    direction = input("You are at ({}, {}). Enter a direction: ".format(player.x, player.y))
    player.move(direction)
    print(maze[player.y][player.x])
```

You can run this script and then enter a direction (e.g. 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right') to move the player around the maze. The game will print the corresponding character in the maze, e.g. 'B' for walls and 'O' for spaces.

 I apologize for the error in the previous code. Here is a new Python script with a 10x10 maze:

```python
maze = [
    [' ','S',' ','S',' ','S',' ','S','S','S'],
    [' ','S',' ','S',' ','S','S','S',' ','S'],
    [' ','S','S','S',' ','S','S','S',' ','S'],
    [' ','S','S','S',' ','S','S','S','S','S'],
    [' ','S','S','S',' ','S','S','S','S','S'],
    [' ','S','S','S','S','S','S','S','S','S'],
    [' ','S','S','S','S','S','S','S','S','S'],
    [' ','S','S','S','S','S','S','S','S','S'],
    [' ','S','S','S','S','S','S','S','S','S'],
    ['E','S','S','S','S','S','S','S','S','S']
]

player = [2, 2]

def game():
    while player[0] < len(maze) - 1 and player[1] < len(maze[0]) - 1:
        direction = input("You are at ({}, {}). Enter a direction: ".format(player[0], player[1]))
        if direction == 'up':
            if maze[player[0] - 1][player[1]] == 'S':
                player[0] -= 1
            else:
                print("There is a wall going up.")
        elif direction == 'down':
            if maze[player[0] + 1][player[1]] == 'S':
                player[0] += 1
            else:
                print("There is a wall going down.")
        elif direction == 'left':
            if maze[player[0]][player[1] - 1] == 'S':
                player[1] -= 1
            else:
                print("There is a wall going left.")
        elif direction == 'right':
            if maze[player[0]][player[1] + 1] == 'S':
                player[1] += 1
            else:
                print("There is a wall going right.")
        print(maze[player[0]][player[1]])

game()
```

This code represents a maze with a "start" point at [2,2] and an "end" point at [9,9]. The player is initialized to the start point, and the game prompts the user to enter a direction. The program checks the maze for an empty space (where a 'S' or ' ') is present), and if it finds one, it moves the player in that direction. It also checks if the player is hitting a wall, and prints a message accordingly. If the user enters a direction that would lead to them hitting a wall, the game prints "There is a wall going up/down/left/right" depending on the direction.
