#  Flappy Bird is a popular mobile game where you tap or click to flap the bird and move it forward. The aim of the game is to avoid hitting pipes on the way. To build this game, you need to use the concepts of game physics, events, and collision detection.

# The Bird class is responsible for the sprite of the bird.
# The Pipe class is responsible for the sprite of the pipe.

# Here's a simple yet incomplete implementation of Pipe drawing:

# ```Python
import pygame
import random
pygame.init()

# Setting the size of the window (400 x 600)
window = pygame.display.set_mode((400, 600))
# What is in the background
background = pygame.Surface((400, 600))
background.fill((255, 255, 255))

class Pipe():
    def __init__(self, height, gap):
        self.height = height
        self.gap = gap
        self.speed = 5

    def draw(self, window):
        # Here we will draw the pipe at the top and the bottom of the screen
        # We create pipes in pairs so we need 2 rectangles
        pygame.draw.rect(window, (255,255,255), (0, self.height - self.gap, 400, self.height)) # Draw top pipe
        pygame.draw.rect(window, (255,255,255), (0, 600 - self.height - self.gap, 400, self.height)) # Draw bottom pipe

# This function is used to update the display
def update_display():
    window.blit(background,(0, 0))

def main():
    pipes = []
    all_pipes = []
    while True:
        # Handle the events
        # Update the display
        update_display()
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                pygame.quit()
                exit()
            if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
                # Add new pipes
                height = random.randint(0, 600 - pipe_height)
                gap_size = random.randint(50, 150)
                pipe = Pipe((height, gap_size))
                # This will draw the pipes on the left side of the screen moving towards the right side
                pipes.append(pipe)
                all_pipes.append(pipe)
            if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN and event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
                # Add new pipes
                height = random.randint(0, 600 - pipe_height)
                gap_size = random.randint(50, 150)
                pipe = Pipe((height, gap_size))
                # This will draw the pipes on the right side of the screen moving towards the left side
                pipes.append(pipe)
        for pipe in pipes:
            pipe.draw(window)
pygame.display.flip()

main()
# ```

# This is a basic implementation of a Flappy Bird clone using the PyGame library in Python. It randomly places pipes above and below the screen with a random gap between them and then gradually moves them towards the middle of the screen. The pipes are drawn using the `draw()` method of the `Pipe` class. It creates two rectangles of height `self.height` and width `400` pixels each at positions `0` and `600 - self.height` pixels down from the top of the screen (so upper pipe is at the top and lower pipe is at the bottom). The gap between these two pipes is created by drawing two rectangles that go right up to the edges of the screen, leaving no space for the bird to fit through them anymore as it moves towards the middle of the screen.
